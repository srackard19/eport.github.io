        <h1>Outcome #1: Writing Processes & Adaptation</h1>
        <p>Outcome #1: Students will be able to describe and reflect on writing processes in order to flexibly adapt them to support their goals.
The process of learning to adapt my writing has been gradual. Initially, I found it difficult to let go of my usual process and experiment with new approaches. But after revising several pieces based on peer and instructor feedback, I understood that writing is an evolving process. Each assignment provided an opportunity to reflect on what worked and what didn’t, helping me refine my strategies. The research proposal and literary analysis essay were two major tasks that helped me practice adapting my writing process. For these, I had to be flexible—shifting from a more creative approach to something more formal and structured—and that experience taught me to recognize when it’s time to modify my usual writing habits.</p>
